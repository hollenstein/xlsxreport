# XlsxReport

## Introduction

XlsxReport is a Python package for automatically generating formatted excel reports from
quantitative mass spectrometry result tables. YAML template files are used to describe
the content of a result table and the format of the excel report.


## Release

Development is currently in early alpha and the interface is not yet stable.


## Install

If you do not already have a Python installation, we recommend installing the
[Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) of Continuum Analytics,
which already contains a large number of popular Python packages for Data Science.
Alternatively, you can also get Python from the
[Python homepage](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows). XlsxReport requires Python
version 3.9 or higher.

You can use pip to install XlsxReport from the distribution file with the following
command:

```
pip install xlsxreport-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl
```

To uninstall the XlsxReport package type:

```
pip uninstall xlsxreport
```


### Installation when using Anaconda

If you are using Anaconda, you will need to install the XlsxReport package into a conda
environment. Open the Anaconda navigator, activate the conda environment you want to
use, run the "CMD.exe" application to open a terminal, and then use the pip install
command as described above.


### Setting up the AppData directory

After XlsxReport has been installed the local AppData directory needs to be setup and
the default template files need to be copied. Running the "xlsxreport_setup" script
creates a new XlsxReport folder in the local user data directory, for example
"C:/User/user_name/AppData/Local/XlsxReport" on Windows 10, and copies the default
template files there.

```
xlsxreport_setup
```


## Run a script

To generate a simple excel protein report, run the "xlsxreport" script with an input
and template file. Here is an example with the default maxquant.yaml template file.

```
xlsxreport proteinGroups.txt maxquant.yaml
```
