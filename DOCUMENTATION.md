# XlsxReport

## Introduction

XlsxReport is a Python library that simplifies the creation of well-formatted Excel reports from CSV files of quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) results. It utilizes YAML template files to specify the arrangement and formatting of the CSV content in the resulting Excel file.

With XlsxReport, generating Excel reports for mass spectrometry results from the same software or pipeline is a breeze â€“ just create a YAML report template file once and execute a command line script to create reproducibly formatted Excel reports whenever needed.

The two main applications of XlsxReport are to create clean and uncluttered Excel files for the manual inspection of MS results, and to create Excel reports that can be used as supplementary tables for publications.


## The XlsxReport report template document

To generate the formatted Excel report, XlsxReport requires an input CSV file and a report template in YAML format. The report template is used to describe the structure and formatting of the generated Excel report. This allows specifying which columns should appear in the Excel file, the order of the columns, and which columns will be grouped together into sections. The report template file allows specifying the format of headers, and applying individual formats and conditional formats to the content of each column. Moreover, it is possible to specify section supheaders that will be written above the header row into a merged cell.

It is not possible to use the report template for renaming column headers, applying calculations to column values, and for sorting rows. In general, anything that changes the data is not the scope of XlsxReport, if such a functionality is required it should be implemented in another script that can be run before XlsxReport.


### How does the report template file look like

The report template file comprises four areas named `sections`, `formats`, `conditional_formats`, and `settings`. The `sections` area is used to select and organize columns, and to specify their formatting by assigning formats and conditional formats that are defined in the `formats` and `conditional_formats` areas. For example, a format determines decimal digits or alignment, whereas conditional formats define cell appearance based on values. The `settings` area is used to define general settings like row height, whether to apply an autofilter on the header row, or if a section supheader row should be added.

Here is a simple example of a report template that is used to generate an Excel file with tree columns: "Protein ID", "Gene name", and "Spectral count". It contains only one entry, "protein_evidence", in the `sections` area. In the "protein_evidence" section three columns are selected and a default format "str" is applied to all column values. In addition, the "int" format and the "count" conditional format are specifically applied to the values of the "Spectral count" column, overriding the defaults. Finally, a supheader "Protein evidence" is defined, which will be written to the excel above the header row. Writing supheader is enabled because the `settings` area contains the entry "write_supheader: True". In the `formats` area the two formats "int" and "str" are defined that have been referenced in the "protein_evidence" section. In addition, the format specified by the "header" and "supheader" entries are applied to the header and supheader row. The `conditional_formats` area contains one conditional format called "count", which has been assigned to the "Spectral count" column in the "protein_evidence" section.

```YAML
sections:
  protein_evidence: {
    columns: ["Protein ID", "Gene name", "Spectral count"],
    column_format: {"Spectral count": "int"},
    column_conditional: {"Spectral count": "count"},
    format: "str",
    supheader: "Protein evidence",
  }

formats:
  int: {"align": "center", "num_format": "0"}
  str: {"align": "left"}
  header: {"bold": True, "align": "center", "bottom": 2}
  supheader: {"bold": True, "align": "center", "bottom": 2}

conditional_formats:
  count: {
    "type": "2_color_scale",
    "min_type": "num", "min_value": 0, "min_color": "#ffffbf",
    "max_type": "percentile", "max_value": 99.5, "max_color": "#f25540"
  }

settings:
  write_supheader: True
  add_autofilter: True
  header_height: 95
```


### The template section area - `sections`

Each entry in the `sections` area is defined by a unique name and contains a set of parameters that describe a group of columns that will be written to the excel file as a section. There are currently three different categories of template sections, each provides a different way how the columns for the section are selected. In addition, the parameters specified in a `template section` describe how the column values and headers will be formatted, if conditional formats are applied, and other settings. The order of `template sections` in the template file determines the order in which the sections, and thus the columns, are written to the excel file.

#### Default sections
In a `default section` columns are directly selected by specifying a list of column names with the `columns` parameter. The specified order of columns defines in which order the columns will be written to the Excel sheet. Formats and conditional formats can be applied to the whole section or to individual columns. The parameters `tag` and `comparison_group` are not allowed in this section. The parameters `log2`, `replace_comparison_tag`, and `remove_tag` have no effect on this section type.

##### Additional section parameters
- Required: `columns: list[str]`<br>
--- *Note: Description missing* ---

#### Tag sample sections
In a `tag sample section`, columns are not directly specified with a `columns` parameter but rather by specifying a `tag` that allows the selection of columns containing a specific substring, but that also have a part of the column name different in each CSV file. This allows for example to create a section containing all sample intensity columns, irrespective of how the samples are named. A second, global parameter called `sample_extraction_tag` is used to determine the sample names that together with the specified `tag` make up the column names. The `sample_extraction_tag` is defined in the `settings` area of the template file.


##### Additional section parameters
- Required: `tag: str`<br>
--- *Note: Description missing* ---
If no `supheader` is explicitly specified, the `tag` is used instead.

- Optional: `remove_tag: bool`<br>
--- *Note: Description missing* ---

- Optional: `log2: bool`<br>
--- *Note: Description missing* ---


##### Global settings that specifically affect tag sample sections
- `log2_tag`
- `sample_extraction_tag`
- `evaluate_log2_transformation`


##### How does this look like in practice?**

Let's assume we have the following template, containing a `tag sample section` with the name "intensities":

```YAML
sections:
  intensities: {tag: "Intensity"}

settings:
  sample_extraction_tag: "Intensity"
```

and a CSV file with the following columns

| Protein ID | Intensity sample_1 | Intensity sample_2 |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| P40238     | 1,000,000          | 2,000,000          |

 When generating a report, XlsxReport first extracts sample names by looking for columns containing the `sample_extraction_tag`, removing the tag, and removing leading or trailing white space characters. The remaining strings, in this case "sample_1" and "sample_2", are used as the extracted sample names for all `tag sample sections` of the report template. To assembly the `tag sample section`, columns are selected that contain a combination of the specified `tag`, i.e. "Intensity", and any of the extracted sample names, which are "Intensity sample_1" and "Intensity sample_2".


#### The comparison section

--- *Note: this section needs to be rewritten* ---

The **comparison group** allows defining a block of differential expression
comparison columns. Adding the parameter "comparison_group: True" defines a
comparison group. The columns that belong to a comparison group have a column
name that consists of one part that describes the content of the column, for
example "P-value" or "Fold change", and another part that describes which
samples or experiments are compared, for example "Control vs. Condition". To
identify comparison columns, the comparison symbol must be defined with
the "tag" parameter, in this example the "tag" corresponds to " vs. ", and
the strings that describe the column contents must be listed in the "columns"
parameter, in this example ["P-value", "Fold change"]. In this example the
comparison group would include the columns "P-value Control vs. Condition" and
"Fold change Control vs. Condition".

### Format parameters area - `formats`
In the `formats` area the formats must be defined that are applied in the template sections. In addition, by specifying a format called "header" and "supheader" it is possible to define default formats for the header and supheader row.

Refer to the [XlsxWriter](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/format.html#format-methods-and-format-properties)
documentation for additional information which parameters can be defined for a format.

### Conditional format area - `conditional_formats`
In the `conditional_formats` area the conditional formats must be defined that are applied in the template sections.

Refer to the [XlsxWriter](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/working_with_conditional_formats.html) documentation for additional information which parameters can be defined for a conditional format.


### Settings area - `settings`

The `settings` area is used to define general settings affecting all content that is written to the Excel sheet.

- `supheader_height: float (default: 20)`<br>
Defines the supheader row height in pixels.

- `header_height: float (default: 20)`<br>
Defines the header row height in pixels.

- `column_width: float (default: 64)`<br>
Defines default column width. This parameter is overwritten if a `width` section parameter is defined.

- `log2_tag: str (default "")`<br>
If specified this string is added as a suffix to the supheader or header of a tag section if the `log2` section parameter is defined, and a log2 transformation is applied to the column values.

- `sample_extraction_tag: str (default "")`<br>
String that is used as a substring to collect columns that contain this tag and the  sample names. From each column first the specified tag is removed, then leading and trailing white space characters (space and underscore) are removed, and the remaining string is used as a sample name. The `sample_extraction_tag` should be chosen to select only columns that contain sample names.

- `append_remaining_columns: bool (default: False)`<br>
If True, all remaining columns that are not present in any section are added to the end of the Excel sheet, and the section of appended columns is hidden.

- `write_supheader: bool (default: False)`<br>
If True, a supheader row is added above the header row.

- `evaluate_log2_transformation: bool (default: False)`<br>
If True, column values are evaluated if they appear to be already log transformed before a log2 transformation is applied.

- `remove_duplicate_columns: bool (default: True)`<br>
If True columns that are already present in a section are removed from subsequent sections.

- `add_autofilter: bool (default: True)`<br>
If True, adds an Excel auto filter to the header row.

- `freeze_cols: int (default: 1)`<br>
If a value larger than 0 is specified, freeze pane is applied in the Excel sheet. The selected row for freezing will always be the header row, the selected column is chosen based on the specified value.
